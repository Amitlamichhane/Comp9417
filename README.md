Multivariate Linear Regression with gradient descent 
--All required file to run Linear regression is inside
    : multivariate_gradient_descent
    Which includes 
    clean_data.py : Extracting and Cleaning datas from autoMpg.arff
    gradient_descent.py:  Cost functio, gradient descent and linear regression 
    split_data.py : For cross validation purposes 

To run linear regression:
    python3 main.py 

image file includes all data created from autoMPG.arff
    

Multilayered Percepton Algorithm 


- RUN using python3 mpl.py 
- mpl: includes main and call function generator as well neruons training

- on LinearfunctionGenerator:
    def function_generator(input , Linear_function= False):
    
    default is non linear function generator 
- neurons.py 
    Trains neuron   
    predict.py = checks probablity 
    prints true or false numpy, that checks input with the original output        



Training with pocked Algorithm is only done on single layer perceptron 
-- And can be run by running 


python3 percepton.py
